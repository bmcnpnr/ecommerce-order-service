to be done:
1. Data Consistency: Implement mechanisms to handle failures (e.g., what happens if the Product Microservice is unavailable, or the product ID does not exist). This might involve retry mechanisms, fallbacks, or using a messaging queue for reliable communication.
2. API Design: Ensure your APIs are well-designed and can handle the necessary load. Use API versioning for future compatibility.
3. Security: Secure the communication between services, possibly using OAuth or similar mechanisms.
4. Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling for network issues, service unavailability, and data inconsistencies.
5. Asynchronous Communication: In some cases, especially when dealing with long-running operations, it might be beneficial to use asynchronous communication patterns like event-driven architecture.
